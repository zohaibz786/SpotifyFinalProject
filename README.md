# FINAL PROJECT

## POPULAR SONGS 

### SELECTED TOPIC

Throughout the class we have aquired tools and learned skills that I will be exploiting to achieve a goal that will soothe the mind, this insipred me to choose a topic about music as it is a pleasant sound which combines melodies and harmony to soothe the soul, just like coding is for the mind, This topic is about analyzing popular songs in order to build a prediction tool to determine if a track will be popular or not. I will use Python, Flask, Tableau, pgAdmin and other useful tools to achieve the goal of creating an application that will allow the user to input characteristics of a song to predict if this the song will be popular or not.

### WHY THIS TOPIC?

I strongly believe that I'm not talking just for myself when I say music is one of the greatest things in life, The great German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote:
>"Without music, life would be a mistake.".

I chose this topic because it fuses my two passions, coding and music.
